CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM

TO: Executive Team
FROM: Mike Chen, CEO
DATE: January 18, 2024
RE: Model X-500 Recall Decision

ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED

Following Sarah Johnson's report on the X-500 overheating issues, I met with our legal counsel yesterday. Here are the key points:

1. Recall Cost Analysis:
   - Immediate recall: $2.3M + $1.5M logistics = $3.8M total
   - Delayed recall (after Q1): Could save $800K but increases liability exposure

2. Legal Exposure:
   - Current complaints: 47 customers, 3 injury claims
   - Potential class action if we delay
   - Estimated litigation costs: $5-8M if we don't act now

3. Decision:
   After consulting with counsel, I'm authorizing the immediate recall. Sarah Johnson will lead the implementation starting Monday.

4. Communication Strategy:
   - Press release: January 22
   - Customer notifications: January 23
   - Dealer briefings: January 20

This decision is based on legal advice and should remain confidential until the public announcement.

Mike Chen
CEO, Acme Corporation
