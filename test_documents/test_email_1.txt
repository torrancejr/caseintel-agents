Subject: Product Defect Report - Urgent

Mike,

I need to bring to your attention a serious issue with our Model X-500 product line. We've received 47 customer complaints in the past two weeks about overheating issues. Three customers reported minor burns.

Our quality control team ran tests last week and confirmed the defect is in the thermal regulation circuit. The fix would cost approximately $2.3M to implement across all units.

I recommend we issue a recall immediately. Legal is aware and advising we act quickly to minimize liability.

Please advise on next steps.
