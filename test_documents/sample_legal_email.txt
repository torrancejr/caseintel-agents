Subject: RE: Confidential - Settlement Discussion for Smith v. Acme Corp.

Dear Michael,

Following our privileged conversation yesterday, I wanted to confirm the key points we discussed regarding the settlement negotiations in Smith v. Acme Corp. (Case No. 2023-CV-12345).

ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

As your legal counsel, I must advise you that the plaintiff's latest demand of $2.5 million significantly exceeds our initial assessment of the case value. However, given the recent discovery of the internal memo dated March 3, 2023, which appears to show prior knowledge of the safety defect, I believe we should seriously consider their offer.

Key Timeline Events:
- March 3, 2023: Internal safety report completed by Engineering Department
- March 15, 2023: Product recall decision delayed by Management
- April 2, 2023: Plaintiff injured while using Product Model X-500
- May 10, 2023: Lawsuit filed in Superior Court

The smoking gun document (the March 3rd memo) could be devastating at trial. The memo explicitly states: "We are aware of the potential safety issue but recommend delaying the recall until Q3 to avoid impacting quarterly earnings."

Witnesses to Consider:
- Dr. Robert Martinez (Engineering Director) - authored the safety report
- Jennifer Williams (VP of Operations) - received the safety report
- Thomas Anderson (CEO) - made final recall decision

My recommendation is to settle within the range of $1.8M - $2.2M to avoid the risk of a much larger jury verdict. The plaintiff's attorney, David Thompson, has indicated they may be willing to negotiate if we respond by January 30, 2024.

Please keep this communication strictly confidential as it contains attorney work product and litigation strategy.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson, Esq.
